# HKModdingVSExtension

A visual studio extension for aiding the creation of Hollow Knight mods. Includes:
* Project template for a mod with a highly automated build and release cycle
* Item template for a `LocalOverrides.targets` that points to your Hollow Knight install, for working on forks of mods created by the above project template
* Saves your install location and other relevant details to make new mod creation seamless

## Acknowledgements
